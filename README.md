# PipeObject

A simple Cinema 4D plugin for lazy people. It creates pipes from just a single path spline. Internally, of course, it's nothing but a Sweep object.

This plugin demonstrates the following C4D API aspects:
* Generator object plugins, derived from `class ObjectData`
* Writing "wrapper" objects that are just simpler versions of existing objects
